# Axiomatic Non-Closure Notice

## Purpose

This document serves as a time-anchored boundary marker.

It explicitly states that no published artifact associated with this repository
constitutes a complete, final, or exhaustive axiomatic basis for the subject area.

---

## Scope

This repository does not provide:
- a closed axiomatic system
- a complete foundational framework
- a set of axioms sufficient for derivation or implementation
- a normative or authoritative theory

Any such interpretation exceeds the intended scope of this publication.

---

## Non-Closure Statement

The existence of an axiomatic layer is acknowledged.

However, no claim of completeness, closure, or finality is made.
The axiomatic basis relevant to this work is intentionally not presented as closed.

No finite set of published statements should be interpreted
as defining the total axiomatic ground of the system.

---

## Interpretative Boundary

This publication does not authorize:
- axiomatic closure
- extrapolation of unstated axioms
- substitution of missing structure
- claims of equivalence with existing frameworks

Any interpretation asserting such properties
does so outside the boundary defined here.
